# Welcome
Welcome to my personal page. I am a non-practicing lawyer who has a background in the following: .NET Core (MVC and legacy Web Forms), SQL, and JavaScript. 

I focus on compliance in the LegalTech and RegTech environment, particularly cross-border data exchanges coupled with data privacy.
