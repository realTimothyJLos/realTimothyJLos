# Welcome to My Page

Welcome to my personal page! I am a non-practicing lawyer with a background in the following areas: .NET Core (MVC and legacy Web Forms), SQL, and JavaScript. 

My primary focus is on compliance in the LegalTech and RegTech environment, specifically related to cross-border data exchanges and data privacy. 

My interest in software development began during my elementary school years, although I didn't pursue it actively until I taught myself while attending Purdue University. While studying Political Science and attending law school, I continued to enhance my technical skills.

## Personal Projects

Occasionally, I work on personal projects that may be integrated into #Rante or #FYS. However, it's important to note that the inclusion of these projects on my profile does not imply their usage within #Rante or #FYS. Certain parts or all of the personal projects might be incorporated into either the Rante Cloud or FYS, but repositories associated with them could be removed from my GitHub account to comply with licensing and other legal requirements.

## Alternative Markets

Currently, my focus lies in alternative markets within LegalTech and RegTech. This involves compliance considerations in areas such as crypto, blockchain, and cannabis, specifically in tracking and beneficial ownership.
