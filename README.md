# Welcome
Welcome to my personal page. I am a non-practicing lawyer who has a background in the following: .NET Core (MVC and legacy Web Forms), SQL, and JavaScript. 

I focus on compliance in the LegalTech and RegTech environment, particularly cross-border data exchanges coupled with data privacy. 

I became interested in software development while in elementary school; however, I did not pursue it until teaching myself while at Purdue University. While I studied Political Science and attend law school, I kept improving my technical skills.
